# Compact Bilinear Pooling

This repository contains the tensorflow implementation of Compact Bilinear Pooling.

## Usage

Details of this operation can be seen in `compact_bilinear_pooling_layer` in `compact_bilinear_pooling.py`.
```
def compact_bilinear_pooling_layer(bottom1, bottom2, output_dim, sum_pool=True,
    rand_h_1=None, rand_s_1=None, rand_h_2=None, rand_s_2=None,
    seed_h_1=1, seed_s_1=3, seed_h_2=5, seed_s_2=7, sequential=True,
    compute_size=128)
    """
    Compute compact bilinear pooling over two bottom inputs. Reference:

    Args:
        bottom1: 1st input, 4D Tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, input_dim1].
        bottom2: 2nd input, 4D Tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, input_dim2].
        output_dim: output dimension for compact bilinear pooling.
        sum_pool: (Optional) If True, sum the output along height and width
                  dimensions and return output shape [batch_size, output_dim].
                  Otherwise return [batch_size, height, width, output_dim].
                  Default: True.
        rand_h_1: (Optional) an 1D numpy array containing indices in interval
                  `[0, output_dim)`. Automatically generated from `seed_h_1`
                  if is None.
        rand_s_1: (Optional) an 1D numpy array of 1 and -1, having the same shape
                  as `rand_h_1`. Automatically generated from `seed_s_1` if is
                  None.
        rand_h_2: (Optional) an 1D numpy array containing indices in interval
                  `[0, output_dim)`. Automatically generated from `seed_h_2`
                  if is None.
        rand_s_2: (Optional) an 1D numpy array of 1 and -1, having the same shape
                  as `rand_h_2`. Automatically generated from `seed_s_2` if is
                  None.
        sequential: (Optional) if True, use the sequential FFT and IFFT
                    instead of tf.batch_fft or tf.batch_ifft to avoid
                    out-of-memory (OOM) error.
                    Note: sequential FFT and IFFT are only available on GPU
                    Default: True.
        compute_size: (Optional) The maximum size of sub-batch to be forwarded
                      through FFT or IFFT in one time. Large compute_size may
                      be faster but can cause OOM and FFT failure. This
                      parameter is only effective when sequential == True.
                      Default: 128.
    Returns:
        Compact bilinear pooled results of shape [batch_size, output_dim] or
        [batch_size, height, width, output_dim], depending on `sum_pool`.

## Testing

To test whether it works correctly on your system, run:
```
python compact_bilinear_pooling_test.py
```
The tests pass if no error occurs running the above command.

Note that `sequential=True` (Default) only supports GPU computation, with no CPU kernel available.

# Building

The `sequential_fft/build/sequential_batch_fft.so` is built against TensorFlow
version 1.12.0 with CUDA 8.0 and g++ 5.4.0, which should be compatible with the
official build of TensorFlow 1.12.0 on Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit.

If you set `sequential=True` (Default), you will need this `sequential_batch_fft.so` to be compatible with your TensorFlow installation.

If installed TensorFlow from source, or want to use a different version of TensorFlow
other than 1.12.0 that may be built with a different compiler and a different CUDA
version, you may need to rebuild `sequential_batch_fft.so` with `compile.sh` in `sequential_fft/`,
*using the same CUDA version and a compatible C++ compiler*. To see the compiler version of an official TF build,
run in Python the follows.
```
import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__compiler_version__)
```
